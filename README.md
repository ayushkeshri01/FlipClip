## FlipClip

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source files (.java)
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files (.class) will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

##Usage

This code can be executed by using the Menu.java file in the src folder. A GUI window will open showing two options.

- `Create` : Where we would be shown our IP which the remote side has to enter.
- `Join` : Where we have to enter the IP of the other computer.

Once connected the clipboards will be synced once anything is copied in either of the two computers.
